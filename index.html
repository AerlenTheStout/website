<h1>On this website I will show how to make a website</h1>

  <h2>When I started to make this website for the genius hour project I spent 3 days 
    just trying to find a software that I could code on, but chromebooks can't run .exe 
    files so I could not download a code editor. That means I had to use a online code 
    editer and I finally found one called codeanywhere. </h2>

   <h3>Im also using another app to host this website,its called github.Unfortunately 
     the school that I am working at blocked github so when I get home i have to push 
     it to this website</h3>

<h4>
  this is a exampe

 <textbox>At the start you must chose what code languge you are going to use.I chose 
   HTML5 then you must type this thing ... that makes it so that the computer know that 
   you want to code in HTML5.</textbox>

  <textbox>Then you must type ... to tell the computer that this is the code I want to 
    use, after you need to chose a spot on the web site to put your words so type one 
    of these three words ... </textbox>

    <textbox>To actually write on the web site you type ... in the whatever area you 
      want to write in.</textbox>
