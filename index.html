<h1>On this website I will show how to make a website</h1>

  <h2>When I started to make this website for the genius hour project I spent 3 days just trying to find a software that I could code on, but chromebooks can't run .exe files so I could not download a code editor. That means I had to use a online code editer and I finally found one called codeanywhere. </h2>

   <h3>Im also using another app to host this website,its called github.Unfortunately the school that I am working at blocked github so when I get home i have to push it to this website</h3>




<body>
 <textbox>At the start you must chose what code languge you are going to use.I chose HTML5 then you must type this thing ... that makes it so that the computer know that you want to code in HTML5.</textbox>

  <textbox>Then you must type ... to tell the computer that this is the code I want to use, after you need to chose a spot on the web site to put your words so type one of these three words ... </textbox>

    <textbox>To actually write on the web site you type ... in the whatever area you want to write in.</textbox>
