  <h1>On this website I will show how to make a website</h1>
  <h2>When I started to make this website for the genius hour project I spent 3 days just trying to find a software that I could code on, but chromebooks can't run .exe files so I could not download a code editor. So I had to use a online code editer and
    I finally found one called codeanywhere. </h2>
    <h3>im also using another app to host this website,its called github unfortunately the school that i am working at blocked github so when i get home i have to put it on this website</h3>
