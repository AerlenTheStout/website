  <h1>On this website I will show how to make a website</h1>
  <h2>When I started to make this website for the genius hour project I spent 3 days just trying to find a software that I could code on, but chromebooks can't run .exe files so I could not download a code editor. That means I had to use a online code editer
    and I finally found one called codeanywhere. </h2>
  <h3>im also using another app to host this website,its called github.Unfortunately the school that I am working at blocked github so when I get home i have to push it to this website</h3>
